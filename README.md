# Welcome

As the first person to enter The Athenaeum, an infamously haunted library, in decades, you’ll find yourself far deeper in the stacks that you originally expected. Legends claim that the library was once a beacon of knowledge filled with enthusiastic scholars and cheerful bookworms. Now all that is left are ghosts and cobwebs. Revive this mythical library by breaking the long-standing curse and bringing back its patrons. Fight through a variety of stories and befriend library visitors to restore The Athenaeum to its former glory. In this game, a Unity-based combination of a roguelite and social simulator, players will be able to engage in unique, dynamic dialogue facilitated by a Large Language Model and experience new worlds as they free books from a mysterious curse. 

When engaging in combat, players will experience up to three different levels, each with their own theme based on different types of book genres/media, from fantasy to archived newspaper clippings. Combat controls are relatively simple with a quick main attack, alongside a more powerful special attack to defeat your foes. Once a level is completed, the player will be sent back to the main library hub in which they may be able to turn in quests, talk to NPC’s, or equip different collectable items. 

Upon speaking to NPC’s a text box prompting the user to input their own message will appear, and using an LLM, the NPC will both respond and perform sentiment analysis to change their relationship status with the player. Talk to the patrons for as long (or as short) as you would like, they don’t mind! Keep in mind that your relationship status with each patron will directly affect your stats when it comes to combat, so try to appeal to your customers, unless you’re looking for a challenge. As you develop your relationships with the many new and old patrons of the library, the events that unfolded many years ago may finally start to come to light…
