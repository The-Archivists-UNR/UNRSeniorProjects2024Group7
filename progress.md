We started working on this project in the fall of 2024. Here's what we've accomplished since then!

At the start of the Spring Semester
- had one working level
- integrated one small LLM model for our NPC
- created a protoype for our library hub level
- had created a title UI and rudimentary level UIs

At the midway of the Spring Semester
- had two working levels
- change the way way procedurally generated levels
- switched to using Gemini's API for multiple NPCs
- added a saving system
- had UIs that were specific to each level and themed with each level's genre

At the end of the Spring Semester
- had three working levels and a final boss
- added minigames
- added items
- added stats
- implemented user input filtering for inappropriate words (hate speech, etc)
- added a beginning cutscene
